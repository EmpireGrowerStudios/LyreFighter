# LyreFighter

LyreFighter is a very quick and dirty reskin of the Godot Engine 2D gaming tutorial using my own graphic and audio assets. The game is playable, barely, and needs a lot of polish. The project was intended to learn Godot Engine's scripting language and IDE layout. As this is just a reskin of Godot's own code, it is being released under the MIT license - do with it as you will.

Comment on the site if you know how to fix the error of the ship running into nothing and resetting.
